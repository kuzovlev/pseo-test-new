However, employers and designers still confuse this profession with others since it\u2019s hard to encapsulate all possible product design services one may need. For instance, a designer may apply for a product designer position, but the company needs a UX designer. \u00a0<br/><br/>To avoid this confusion, let\u2019s first clarify the difference between these two since both may create visuals that improve users\u2019 interactions with your product.<br/><br/>Firstly, let\u2019s understand that \u201cproduct designer\u201d is a broader term than \u201cUX designer.\u201d A product designer uses a more holistic approach to design. They analyze complex data, define your goals while aligning them with your user\u2019s objectives, and integrate your ambitions into the product design. Meanwhile, the primary responsibility of a UX designer is to ensure that such a product is usable and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Henry Wu, a product design manager at Hubspot, summarizes these senses in the following statement: \u201cA Product Designer, at its core, is a problem solver.\u201d<br/><br/>Simply put, if both specialists are on your team, the product design services will most often be in the decision-making while the UX designer prepares design pitches and does the technical work.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer-40\"></div>\n<div class=\"text-20 weight-semibold lh-128\">Similarities</div>\n<div class=\"spacer-20\"></div>\n<ul class=\"unordered-list\" role=\"list\">\n<li class=\"text-18 weight-regular lh-145\">Both specialists focus on creating a better overall product and experience for the end-user.</li>\n<li class=\"text-18 weight-regular lh-145\">UX and product designers use critical thinking to analyze complex data and do market research.</li>\n<li class=\"text-18 weight-regular lh-145\">They often use similar wireframing tools, such as Balsamiq and Sketch, as well as user mapping software, like LucidChart and Overflow.</li>\n<li class=\"text-18 weight-regular lh-145\">UX designers, as well as product designers, base their processes on users\u2019 needs and requests.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"spacer-144 tablet_spacer-128\"></div>\n</section>";
